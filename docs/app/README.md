# Mobile App Documentation

**Status:** Future Phase

Mobile apps (iOS/Android) will be built after the web platform is stable.

---

## Coming Soon

- **Setup Guide** - Getting started with React Native
- **Architecture** - App structure and patterns
- **Block System** - Reusing block data model
- **Native Components** - Mobile-specific UI

---

## Design Principles

The mobile app will:

- **Consume the same API** as the web app
- **Reuse the block data model** for content
- **Share types** with the web frontend
- **Provide native experiences** (push notifications, offline mode, etc.)

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Framework:** React Native (Expo)
- **API Client:** Shared with web
- **State:** Same patterns as web
- **Storage:** AsyncStorage / SecureStore

---

**Check back after web platform and API are complete!**
